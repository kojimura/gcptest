# Basic TinyProxy configuration

# Port to listen on inside the container
Port 8888

# Allow connections TO the proxy from any source.
# Since we map this port to 127.0.0.1 on the host,
# only connections from your Windows host's localhost will reach it.
Allow all

# --- Outbound Destination Control ---
# Deny outbound connections for HTTP and HTTPS.
# Rules are processed top-to-bottom. The first matching rule wins.
# Deny all
# Deny HTTP requests to specific domains (using wildcards for subdomains)
Deny *.xxx.co.jp

# Deny CONNECT requests (HTTPS) to specific domains (using wildcards for subdomains)
ConnectDeny *.xxx.co.jp

# Allow all other outbound connections by default.
# Since no other Deny/ConnectDeny rules exist below, any destination
# not matching the above Yahoo rules will be allowed.
# (No explicit "Allow all destinations" line is needed here,
# as this is the default behavior when no Deny rule matches).

# Other standard configurations can be left as default or commented out.
# Example: Uncomment the lines below if you want logs (useful for debugging)
# LogFile "/var/log/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.log"
# Syslog On

# Example: Disable the Via header
# DisableViaHeader Yes

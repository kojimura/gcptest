# Basic TinyProxy configuration for a dummy server

# Port to listen on inside the container
Port 8888

# Allow connections from ANY source.
# Since we will map this port to 127.0.0.1 on the host,
# only connections from your Windows host's localhost will reach it.
# This is the simplest way to allow the host to connect.
Allow all

# Deny ALL outbound connections.
# This is the key setting that makes this a "dummy" proxy
# that does not forward requests to the real internet based on its rules.
# Note: This will typically result in a 403 Forbidden error for the client
# attempting to use this proxy for external sites.
Deny all

# Other standard configurations can be left as default or commented out.
# Refer to the TinyProxy documentation for more options if needed.

# Example: Disable the Via header for slightly more anonymity (not relevant for a dummy)
# DisableViaHeader Yes

# Uncomment the lines below if you want logs (useful for debugging)
# LogFile "/var/log/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.log"
# Syslog On
